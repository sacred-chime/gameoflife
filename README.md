## About The Project

[![Conway's Game of Life Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/sacred-chime)

My implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). Built with Python, FastAPI, and HTMX. The purpose of this project is to create a demo that uses FastAPI and HTMX for the sake of learning.

The technologies that are new to me within this project:

- [![htmx][htmx.com]][HTMX-url]
